## Production

In October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), titled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with Part 2 scheduled for May 3, 2019. That same month, Kevin Feige said the films were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between the films, but he felt they would be "two distinct" films, not one story split across two films. In May 2016, the Russos revealed that they would be retitling the two films, to further remove this misconception.

## Release

Avengers: Endgame had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019. Avengers: Endgame grossed $858.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.939 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.798 billion.

## Home media

Avengers: Endgame was released in the US on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13. The film was released on both Digital HD and Blu-ray on September 2 in the UK. Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings

## Soundtrack album

In June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers, was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and Endgame. The Russos started working with Silvestri on the Endgame score in early November 2018, and it was completed in late March 2019. A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24. A music video for the track "Portals", composed for the climactic scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.
